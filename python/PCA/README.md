# Federated PCA

## vertical folder
The [vertical](/vertical) folder contains scripts for the simulation of federated principal component analysis for vertically partionned data. 

If you are interested in a python code for the simulation, have a look at [simulate_federated_vertically_partionned_pca.py](vertical/simulate_federated_vertically_partionned_pca.py) it contains a visual-spam free version of the codes in the directry. Same goes for [simulate_federated_qr_orthogonalisation.py](vertical/simulate_federated_qr_orthogonalisation.py). The scripts rely on other scripts in the folder (PCA) so you need to get all necessary scripts to run the code.

## horizontal folder

The [horizontal](/horizontal) folder contains scripts for the simulation of federated principal component analysis for horizontally partionned data.
